# parallax-scrolling-effect
The provided code represents a web page with a visually appealing design and a parallax scrolling effect I created for fun. 

In terms of the technologies I used, I employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the desired functionality and visual presentation. With HTML, I structured the page and defined its elements. CSS allowed me to style the elements, including background images, text colors, fonts, and layout properties. JavaScript, specifically utilizing the jQuery library, played a crucial role in adding interactivity to the page.

I leveraged JavaScript to implement the parallax scrolling effect, dynamically transforming the position of certain elements based on the user's scroll. This combination of technologies seamlessly worked together to create an aesthetically pleasing and engaging web page.
